# RKGist

RKGist is an example application built with [RestKit](http://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) for use in conjunction with the [Getting Acquainted with RestKit](TUTORIAL.md) tutorial.

## Work in Progress

Please be advised that the tutorial is a work in progress and is incomplete but already provides a solid foundation on the basics of using RestKit. It is available in draft form to collect feedback and will be completed for the final release of RestKit v0.20.0.
